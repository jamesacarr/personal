My personal website.

The website is built in Typescript using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Development

In order to develop with this code, clone the repository and run:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The website has hot module reloading, so changes made will show up instantly.

## Deployment

All code pushed to `main` will be automatically deployed. Branches will be deployed to their own environments.
